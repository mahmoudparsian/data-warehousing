## What is ETL? 

	Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is 
	the process of combining data from multiple 
	sources into a large, central repository 
	called a data warehouse. 
	
	ETL uses a set of business rules to clean 
	and organize raw data and prepare it for 
	storage, data analytics, and machine learning 
	(ML). You can address specific business 
	intelligence needs through data analytics 
	(such as predicting the outcome of business 
	decisions, generating reports and dashboards, 
	reducing operational inefficiency, and more).
