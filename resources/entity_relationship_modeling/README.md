# Entity-Relationhip Model

## [Introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model)

An entity–relationship model (or ER model) describes 
interrelated things of interest in a specific domain 
of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity 
types (which classify the things of interest) and 
specifies relationships that can exist between entities 
(instances of those entity types).

In software engineering, an ER model is commonly formed 
to represent things a business needs to remember in order 
to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model 
becomes an abstract data model,[1] that defines a data or 
information structure which can be implemented in a database, 
typically a relational database.

Entity–relationship modeling was developed for database 
and design by Peter Chen and published in a 1976 paper, 
with variants of the idea existing previously, but today 
it is commonly used for teaching students the basics of 
data base structure. Some ER models show super and subtype 
entities connected by generalization-specialization 
relationships,[4] and an ER model can be used also in the 
specification of domain-specific ontologies.
