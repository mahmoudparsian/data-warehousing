<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>1.1 What is a data warehouse?</h3>
<ol>
<li>A data warehouse is

<ul>
<li>A type of data management system
<li>Designed to enable and support <b>business intelligence</b> <br>
    (BI) activities, especially analytics. <br>
</ul>

<li>Data warehouses are solely intended to perform <br>
queries and analysis and often contain large <br>
amounts of historical data. <br>

<li>The data within a data warehouse is usually <br>
derived from a wide range of sources such as <br>
application log files and transaction applications.

<li>A data warehouse is a central repository    <br>
    of information that can be analyzed to make <br>
    more <b>informed decisions</b>.

</ol>

<h3>2. What is a Business Intelligence (BI)?</h3>

<ol>
<li> Business intelligence combines 
<ul>
<li><b>business analytics</b>,
<li><b>data mining</b>, 
<li><b>data visualization</b>, 
<li><b>data tools</b> and <br>
<li>infrastructure, and best practices
</ul>
 to help organizations make <br>
 more <b>data-driven decisions</b>.
<p class>
<li> Business Intelligence refers to a  <br>
     set of processes and technologies  <br>           
     that convert raw data into  usable <br>
     and meaningful information to make <br>
     profitable business decisions. 
<p class>
<li> <b>BI</b> is an umbrella term that combines   <br>
data mining, data tools, business analytics, data  <br>
visualization, infrastructure, and best practices  <br> 
to offer quick-to-digest data summaries and aid an <br>
organization in making more data-driven decisions. 
<p class>
<li> BI serves enterprises to unlock sales and marketing <br>
potential, and innovate new business capabilities.
</ol>

<h3>3 Examples of a Business Intelligence (BI)?</h3>

<h4>3.1 Example of a Business Intelligence (BI)?</h4>
<ul>
<li> What is an example of a business intelligence?       <br>
<li>For example, a retail store generates data regularly <br>
related to purchases. They gather information about  <br>
the seller, age, gender, preferred purchases, and more.   <br>
 
<li>Now, they turn these raw data units into a     <br>
fruitful chunk of information based on which they    <br>
plan their future marketing
</ul>

<h4>3.2 Netflix Example: Business Intelligence (BI) </h4>
<ul>
<li>As the largest subscription streaming service, <br>
Netflix leverages business intelligence and        <br>
data science to gain new subscribers and enhance   <br>
user experiences.                                  <br>
<br>
<li>BI solutions create personalized watch lists   <br>
and compelling artwork while persuading users      <br>
to watch their favorite genres. The recommendation <br>
system promotes content to the right audience at   <br>
the right time.
</ul>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<h3>4. The Purpose of a Data Warehouse?</h3>
<br>The purpose of a data warehouse is 

<ol>
<li>To <u>combine multiple sources</u> to <br>
    create a database (called a Data Warehouse)
<p>
<li>Use Data Warehouse to generate different insights 
<p>
<li>That help companies <u>make better decisions,</u> <br>
    forecasting, and keeping users and making <br>
    them to buy more... 

</ol>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<p class>
<h3>5. Data & Users:</h3>
<ol>
<li>It consists of historical and commutative <br>
    data from single or multiple sources. 
<p>
<li>Most data scientists, big data analysts,   <br>
    and business analysts use a data warehouse <br>
    to get their data. 
    
<li>This data warehouse can store data from  <br>
   <u>multiple sources</u>, including internal devices. 

<li>Data is checked and cleaned before each upload <br>
    to a Data Warehouse
    
</ol>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<h2>What might be Data Warehousing?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Data Warehouses are a place to store our data. <br>

<li>To <u>make better decisions</u>.

<li>The data used in the past and the data <br>
            that will be useful in the future are <br>
            stored in a Data Warehouse. <br>
         
<li>A Data Warehouse would consist of all raw data <br>
    used or related to the organization/company. <br>
    
<li>It was constructed by integrating multiple  <br>
    heterogeneous sources of data.              <br>
    
<li> Every company's most valuable asset is information. <br>
    This information is used for operational record      <br>
    keeping and analytical decision-making.              <br>

<li>Operational Databases might change over time. 

<li>If a company/organization wants to analyze previous <br>
    actions or profits on data, it may not find data as <br>
    previous data would have been updated. In this      <br>
    scenario, Data Warehouse comes into the picture. 

<li>A data warehouse would consist of all the data <br>
    related to an organization from which we can <br>
    get our data. <br>
    
<li>It helps in the integration of a diversity of application systems. <br>

<li>A data warehouse is a <u>data management system</u> <br>
    that facilitates and supports business intelligence <br>
    (BI) activities and analysis. <br>

<li>These are primarily designed to contain large amounts <br>
    of historical data and to analyze the searches. <br>
    
<li>Unlike operational databases, warehouses are <br>
    not updated frequently. <br>
</ol>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<h4>Importance of Data Warehouse</h4>
<ol>
<li>They extract data from several sources and process     <br>
    it through <b>ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)</b> to <br>
    load data into the data warehouse.
</li>
<li>Data Warehouses improves the <b>speed</b> and <b>efficiency</b> <br>
    of accessing different datasets and helps decision-makers <br>
    to derive insights that will guide them to be apart from  <br>
    their competitors.
</li>
<li>Data Warehouse is highly <b>scalable</b> and efficient, <br>
    enhancing data conformity and quality<b>.</b>
</li>
<li>Data Warehouse is a single source for all the data <br>
    in the organization/company.
</li>
<li><b>A data</b> warehouse <b>platform allows</b> business   <br>
    leaders to access their organization's past activities    <br>
    and assess past initiatives successes or failures<b>.</b> <br>
    This helps executives to see where they can <b>reduce costs, <br>
    maximize efficiency, and increase sales</b> to boost profit.
</li>
</ol>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<h4>The goals of Data Warehouse / BI systems would be:</h4>
<ol>
<li> Data Warehouse / BI systems must  <br>
     make systems easily accessible.
</li>
     
<li> Data Warehouse / BI systems must <br>
     present information consistently.
</li>
     
<li> These systems must adapt to change.</li>

<li> Data Warehouse / BI systems must  <br> 
     present information promptly.
</li>

<li> Systems must be secure bastion that  <br>
     protects the information assets.
</li>

<li> They should work as authoritative and  <br>
     trustworthy for improved decision-making.
</li>

</ol>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<h2>Divide Data Warehouse into 4 Stages</h2>
<p class>For better understanding, we can divide <br>
any data warehouse into 4 stages of the process.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="aligncenter" src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/62160Data_warehouse_architecture.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" width="434" height="254" /><figcaption class>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>

<ul>
<li><b>1. Collect</b><br>
<li><b>2. Store</b><br>
<li><b>3. Analyze </b><br>
<li><b>4. Consume</b><br>
</ul>

<p class><b>1. Collect</b><br>
At the collect stage, we fetch the <b>raw data</b> <br>
from the source systems and store the data         <br>
in a layer named the staging layer. This process   <br>
is called ETL (Extract, Transform and Load data).  <br>
There are various tools to enable ETL for the      <br>
data warehouse.</p>

<p class><b>2. Store</b><br>
We are preparing to store data for our present <br>
or future information analysis in operational  <br>
databases or in some other source.</p>

<p class><b>3. Analyze </b><br>
Structuring the raw data into an understandable <br>
format helps business analysts or decision-makers <br>
to get insights from various analyses and <br>
visualizations of the data.</p>

<p class><b>4. Consume</b><br>
At this stage, various tools like Power BI <br>
and Apache Spark are available to help explore <br>
data in detail.</p>

<p class>
All these stages tell us the structure or <br>
process of the data warehouse.</p>

<hr style="width:150%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">

<h2>Characteristics of the Data Warehouse</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>1. Integrated</b>
<li><b>2. Non-Volatile</b>
<li><b>3. Subject Oriented</b> 
<li><b>4. Time Variant</b>
</ul>

<p class><b>1. Integrated:</b>
<ul>
<li>Data warehouses are built by integrating data <br>
    from <b>disparate</b> sources such as relational <br>
    <b>databases</b> and <b>flat files</b>.

<li>Data Warehouse consists of data that has been <br>
    combined from numerous sources. The data can  <br>
    be obtained from many sources:
    <ul>
      <li> flat files,   
      <li> SQL databases, and
      <li> various other sources... 
    </ul>
    
<li>This integration enhances effective <b>data analysis.</b> <br>
    Data must be stored consistently and universally          <br>
    acceptable in a warehouse.</p>
</ul>

<p class><b>2. Nonvolatile:</b> 
<ul>
<li>No matter what data it is, it does not change <br>
once it enters the warehouse or is not removed    <br>
from it. 
<li>Operational and data warehouses are kept separate. <br>
So, the <b>frequent changes</b> in the operational <br>
database are <b>not reflected</b> in the data warehouse.</p>
</ul>

<p class><b>3. Subject Oriented:
<ul>
<li>Data Warehouse concentrates on a <b>particular 
    subject area</b> such as SALES, PRODUCTS, ...

<li></b> Data Warehouses are subject-oriented because they <br>
provide <b>information</b> about topics <b>rather than ongoing <br>
operations </b>in an <b>organization</b>. 

<li>Topics may be products, suppliers, customers, etc. 

<li>A data warehouse concentrates on <b>modeling</b> <br>
and <b>analyzing data</b> for decision-making rather <br>
than performing day-to-day operations</p>

</ul>

<p class><b>4. Time Variant: 
<ul>
<li></b>Information acquired from the data warehouse <br>
is identified by a specific period. 
<li>The data warehouse would contain information <br>
on historical trends.</p>
</ul>

<h2>The Architecture of the Data Warehouse</h2>
<div>Data Warehouse architecture comprises a three-tier architectural structure.</div>

<figure><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/98685Data_warehouse_architecture.jpeg" alt="Data Warehouse" width="317" height="159" /><figcaption class>Source: Astera Software</figcaption></figure>

<div>
<p><b>There are 3 approaches for constructing a Data Warehouse architecture </b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Single Tier</b></li>
<li><b>Two-tier</b></li>
<li><b>Three Tier</b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Single Tier <span style="text-align: left;">Architecture</span></h4>
</div>
<p class>

<ol>
<li> The main reason for this architecture <br>
     is to minimize storage levels. 
<li> The main goal of this architecture is <br>
     to remove data redundancy.</p>
</ol>

<h4>Two Tier Architecture</h4>
<p class>
<ol>
<li>
It is also one of the Data Warehouse layers  <br>
that separate physically available sources and  <br>
the data warehouse. 
<li> This architecture does not support a large number<br>
     of end-users, and it is also not expandable.
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Three Tier Architecture</h4>
<p class>
The most widely used architecture of the Data <br>
 Warehouse consists of a top, middle, and bottom tier.<b><br/>
</b></p>
<h4>1. Bottom Tier</h4>
<p class>
The bottom tier or data warehouse server usually <br>
represents a relational database system. To cleanse, <br>
transform and feed data into the layer, back-end tools are used.</p>
<h4>2. Middle Tier</h4>
<div>
<p>It represents an OLAP server that can be implemented in two ways</p>
<ol>
<li> ROLAP (Relational Online Analytical Processing)</b> <br>
     servers are usually placed between the relational   <br>
     backend server and the client front-end server.     <br>
     It performs dynamic multidimensional data analysis  <br>
     and maps it to a standard relational process.</p>

<li> MOLAP (Multidimensional Online Analytical Processing</b>) <br>
    deals directly with multidimensional data and operations.</p>
</ol>
</div>
<p class><b>3. Top Tier</b></p>
<p class>Top Tier is a client-side interface that  <br>
         gets data from the data warehouse. It consists   <br>
         of tools like query tools, analysis tools,  <br>
         reporting tools, and data mining tools.<b><br/>
</b></p>

<h2>Data Warehouse Components</h2>

<figure><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/58642Approach.png" alt="Data Warehouse" width="1024" height="371" /><figcaption class>Source: InterviewBit</figcaption></figure>

<h4>1. Data Warehouse Database</h4>
<p class>
1.1 The most significant component of the  <br>
    Data Warehouse is the <b>database</b>. <br><br>
    
1.2 It was implemented with RDBMS technology.   <br>
    However, this type of implementation is     <br>
    limited because traditional RDBMS systems   <br>
    are optimized for processing transactional  <br>
    databases and not for data warehouses.      <br><br>

1.3 There are a few alternatives, like deploying  <br>
    RDBMS in parallel, which allows shared memory  <br>
    on various multiprocessor configurations,       <br>
    using new index structures to bypass relational   <br>
    table scans, etc. These are approaches to databases.<br>

<h4>2. ETL (Extract, Transformation, and Loading Tools)</h4>

<figure><img  src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/60394elt.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" width="434" height="254" /></figure>


<ol>
<li>These tools are responsible for extracting data  <br>
from various sources, transforming it into a         <br>
digestible format, and loading it into the data      <br>
warehouse. 

<li>There are many functionalities like anonymizing <br>
    data, eliminating unwanted data loading into    <br>
    the Data Warehouse, getting a summary,          <br>
    populating missing data with defaults, etc. 
    
<li> In ETL tools. These tools can also generate       <br> 
background jobs, shell scripts, etc., that update data. <br>
<li> These tools help maintain the metadata.            <br>
</ol>

<h4>3. Metadata</h4>
<ul>
<li>Metadata is defined as the information  <br>
    that <b>describes and explains data.</b>
    
<li>Metadata provides context with details <br>
such as the source, type, owner, and <br>
relationships to other data sets. 

<li> Metadata can help you understand the relevance  <br>
of a particular data set and guide you on how to <br>
use it. In a nutshell: Metadata is a cornerstone <br>
of a modern enterprise data stack. <br>
</ul>

<pre>
   -- EXAMPLE-1
   -- CREATE a DATABASE TABLE
   create table Sales (
      transaction_id STRING,
      customer_id    STRING,
      amount         DOUBLE,
      ...
    )

   -- EXAMPLE-2
   -- SHOW ALL TABLEs ending with 'sales'
   show tables like '%sales'
</pre>


<figure><img  src="https://www.altoros.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/operational-metadata-for-etl-and-data-warehousing.png" alt="Data Warehouse" width="434" height="254" /></figure>

<p class>
Metadata is data that defines the data warehouse,         <br>
which is used in building, maintaining, and managing      <br>
data warehouses. It provides various frameworks enabling  <br>
the above usages. These are the essential and critical    <br>
ingredients in transforming data into knowledge.</p>
<p class>Metadata can be classified into two categories.</p>
<p class><b>1. Technical Meta Data:</b> This contains <br>
            information about the warehouse which is used <br>
            by data warehouse designers and administrators.</p>
<p class><b>2. Business Meta Data:</b> This contains information <br>
            that is easily understood by end users.</p>

<h4>4. Data Warehouse Access / Query Tools</h4>
<p class>
Access tools allow users to interact with the <br>
data warehouse system. These warehouse tools  <br>
include query and reporting tools, data mining, <br>
OLAP, and application development tools.</p>
<p class>These tools are divided into four different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query and reporting tools</li>
<li>Application Development tools</li>
<li>Data mining tools</li>
<li>OLAP tools</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Data Warehouse Business architecture</h4>
<p class>
This architecture defines the data flow in a <br>
data warehousing system and includes a data mart <br>
in it. The data flow can be categorized as <br>
Up flow, Down flow, Outflow, and Meta flow.</p>

<h4>6. Data Warehouse Reporting Layer</h4>
<p class>The reporting layer in the data warehouse <br>
         allows the end user to access the business <br>
         intelligence (BI) interface or BI database <br>
         architecture. It acts as a dashboard for <br>
         visualizing and creating reports and pulling <br>
         out all the required information.</p>

<h2>Data Marts</h2>

<figure><img  src="https://www.acumence.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-is-data-mart-and-data-warehouse-diagram.png" alt="Data Warehouse" width="434" height="254" /></figure>


<ol>
<li>This is an access level that allows users to          <br>
    access or transfer data. It takes less time           <br>
    and money to build, so it is the most cost-effective  <br>
    option for large-size data warehouses. It is used     <br>
    as a partition of data that is created for a specific <br>
    group of users.</p>
         
<li>A "Data Mart" is a subset of a data warehouse       <br>
    built to maintain a particular department,          <br>
    region, or business unit. Every department of       <br>
    a business has a central repository or data mart    <br>
    to store data.
         
<li>A "Data Mart" is a simple form of data warehouse    <br>
    focused on a single subject or line of business.    <br>
    With a data mart, teams can access data and gain    <br>
    insights faster, because they don’t have to spend   <br>
    time searching within a more complex data warehouse <br>
    or manually aggregating data from different sources.
  
</ol>
         
<h2>Life Cycle of a Data Warehousing</h2>
<p class>Several steps must be followed in order <br>
to build a successful data warehouse with implementation.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/15979lifecycle.jpg" alt="life cycle" width="1100" height="525" /><figcaption class>Source: GeeksforGeeks</figcaption></figure>

<p class>The above diagram indicates the life cycle <br>
         of data warehousing involving steps for the <br>
         successful completion of data warehousing.</p>

<h2>Latest Tools and Technologies in Data Warehousing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data Warehousing helps businesses to get deep <br>
    insights from even large amounts of data. 
<li>It improved its access to information, reduced <br>
    response time for queries, etc. Today, cloud   <br>
    technology has reduced the cost and effort to  <br>
    build infrastructure for data warehousing. 
<li>There are various tools and technologies for    <br>
    data warehousing. Cloud-based data warehousing  <br>
    tools are fast, highly scalable, efficient, and <br>
    available regularly. <br>
    Some of the Data Warehousing tools are:

    can help make future decisions.
</li>

<li>This also helps companies to store a large <br>
    amount of data and keep track of it. 
</li>
</ul>

<p class>Some of the beneficial and summarized points would be</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Data Warehouse is a system that contains <br>
    historical and commutative data from multiple <br>
    sources. These sources can be Cloud Data Warehouse, <br>
    Virtual Data Warehouse, or Traditional Data Warehouses.
</li>

<li>2. Data Warehouse is subject-oriented, <br>
    non-volatile, and Time-variant.
</li>
    
<li>3. Data Warehouse metadata provides information <br>
    regarding the data warehouse data source, usage, <br>
    and features.
