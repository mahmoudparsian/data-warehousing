# Database Normalization

## What is a Database Normalization

	Database normalization is the process 
	of organizing  data in a  database to 
	eliminate  redundancy, improve  data 
	integrity, and make the database more 
	flexible: 

	Eliminate redundancy: 
		Redundant data wastes disk space 
		and creates maintenance problems. 

	Improve data integrity: 
		Normalized relations mirror real-world 
		concepts and their interrelationships. 

	Make the database more flexible: 
		A fully normalized database can be extended 
		to accommodate new types of data without 
		changing existing structure too much. 

	Here are some benefits of database normalization: 
		Simplifies the query process, 
		Improves workflow, 
		Increases security, and 
		Lessens costs. 

	Normalization is commonly used when dealing with 
	large datasets. It involves breaking down a large, 
	complex table into smaller and simpler tables while 
	maintaining data relationships.
