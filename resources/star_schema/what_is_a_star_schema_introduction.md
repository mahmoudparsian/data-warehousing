* What is a **star schema**? A star schema is a 
  **multi-dimensional data model** used to organize 
  data in a database so that it is easy to understand 
  and analyze. 

* Star schemas can be applied to data warehouses, 
  databases, data marts, and other tools. 

* The star schema design is optimized for querying 
  large data sets.
  
* **Fact tables** and **dimension tables** are key 
  components of a schema in a data warehouse. A 
  **fact table** contains records that combine attributes 
  from different **dimension tables**. These records 
  allow users to analyze different aspects of their 
  business, which can aid in decision-making and 
  improving the business.

  A multidimensional model views data in the form of a data-cube. 
  A data cube enables data to be modeled and viewed in multiple 
  dimensions. It is defined by dimensions and facts.
