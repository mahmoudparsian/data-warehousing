# Metadata in SQL

	1. Metadata in SQL is "data about data"; 

	2. Metadata describes the structure, content, 
	   and context of a database and its objects, 
	   rather than the raw data itself. 
	
	3. This information is stored and managed 
	   within the database system itself, typically 
	   in special tables known as the data dictionary 
	   or system catalog.
