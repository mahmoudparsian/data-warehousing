# Database Normalization

	Database normalization is the process of structuring 
	a relational database in accordance with a series of 
	so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy 
	and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by 
	Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model.

	Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) 
	and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their 
	dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity 
	constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal 
	rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new 
	database design) or decomposition (improving an existing 
	database design).
