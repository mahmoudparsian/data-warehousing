GROUP BY
Groups rows with the same group-by-item expressions and computes aggregate functions for the resulting group. A GROUP BY expression can be:

A column name.

A number referencing a position in the SELECT list.

A general expression.

Extensions:
GROUP BY CUBE , 
GROUP BY ROLLUP
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS , 



GROUP BY CUBE
GROUP BY CUBE is an extension of the GROUP BY clause similar to GROUP BY ROLLUP. In addition to producing all the rows of a GROUP BY ROLLUP, GROUP BY CUBE adds all the “cross-tabulations” rows. Sub-total rows are rows that further aggregate whose values are derived by computing the same aggregate functions that were used to produce the grouped rows.

A CUBE grouping is equivalent to a series of grouping sets and is essentially a shorter specification. The N elements of a CUBE specification correspond to 2^N GROUPING SETS.

GROUP BY ROLLUP
GROUP BY ROLLUP is an extension of the GROUP BY clause that produces sub-total rows (in addition to the grouped rows). Sub-total rows are rows that further aggregate whose values are derived by computing the same aggregate functions that were used to produce the grouped rows.

You can think of rollup as generating multiple result sets, each of which (after the first) is the aggregate of the previous result set. So, for example, if you own a chain of retail stores, you might want to see the profit for:

Each store.

Each city (large cities might have multiple stores).

Each state.

Everything (all stores in all states).

You could create separate reports to get that information, but it is more efficient to scan the data once.

If you are familiar with the concept of grouping sets (GROUP BY GROUPING SETS) you can think of a ROLLUP grouping as equivalent to a series of grouping sets, and which is essentially a shorter specification. The N elements of a ROLLUP specification correspond to N+1 GROUPING SETS.

-- Create some tables and insert some rows.
CREATE TABLE products (product_ID INTEGER, wholesale_price REAL);
INSERT INTO products (product_ID, wholesale_price) VALUES 
    (1, 1.00),
    (2, 2.00);

CREATE TABLE sales (product_ID INTEGER, retail_price REAL, 
    quantity INTEGER, city VARCHAR, state VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO sales (product_id, retail_price, quantity, city, state) VALUES 
    (1, 2.00,  1, 'SF', 'CA'),
    (1, 2.00,  2, 'SJ', 'CA'),
    (2, 5.00,  4, 'SF', 'CA'),
    (2, 5.00,  8, 'SJ', 'CA'),
    (2, 5.00, 16, 'Miami', 'FL'),
    (2, 5.00, 32, 'Orlando', 'FL'),
    (2, 5.00, 64, 'SJ', 'PR');
    
Run a rollup query that shows profit by city, state, and total across all states.

The example below shows a query that has three “levels”:

Each city.

Each state.

All revenue combined.

This example uses ORDER BY state, city NULLS LAST to ensure that each state’s rollup comes immediately after all of the cities in that state, and that the final rollup appears at the end of the output.

SELECT state, city, SUM((s.retail_price - p.wholesale_price) * s.quantity) AS profit 
 FROM products AS p, sales AS s
 WHERE s.product_ID = p.product_ID
 GROUP BY ROLLUP (state, city)
 ORDER BY state, city NULLS LAST
 ;
+-------+---------+--------+
| STATE | CITY    | PROFIT |
|-------+---------+--------|
| CA    | SF      |     13 |
| CA    | SJ      |     26 |
| CA    | NULL    |     39 |
| FL    | Miami   |     48 |
| FL    | Orlando |     96 |
| FL    | NULL    |    144 |
| PR    | SJ      |    192 |
| PR    | NULL    |    192 |
| NULL  | NULL    |    375 |
+-------+---------+--------+

Some rollup rows contain NULL values. For example, the last row in the table contains a NULL value for the city and a NULL value for the state because the data is for all cities and states, not a specific city and state.

GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS is a powerful extension of the GROUP BY clause that computes multiple group-by clauses in a single statement. The group set is a set of dimension columns.

GROUP BY GROUPING SETS is equivalent to the UNION of two or more GROUP BY operations in the same result set:

GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(a) is equivalent to the single grouping set operation GROUP BY a.

GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(a,b) is equivalent to GROUP BY a UNION ALL GROUP BY b.

Examples
These examples use a table of information about nurses who are trained to assist in disasters. All of these nurses have a license as nurses (e.g. an RN has a license as a “Registered Nurse”), and an additional license in a disaster-related specialty, such as search and rescue, radio communications, etc. This example simplifies and uses just two categories of licenses:

Nursing: RN (Registered Nurse) and LVN (Licensed Vocational Nurse).

Amateur (“ham”) Radio: Ham radio licenses include “Technician”, “General”, and “Amateur Extra”.

Here are the commands to create and load the table:

CREATE or replace TABLE nurses (
  ID INTEGER,
  full_name VARCHAR,
  medical_license VARCHAR,   -- LVN, RN, etc.
  radio_license VARCHAR      -- Technician, General, Amateur Extra
  )
  ;

INSERT INTO nurses
    (ID, full_name, medical_license, radio_license)
  VALUES
    (201, 'Thomas Leonard Vicente', 'LVN', 'Technician'),
    (202, 'Tamara Lolita VanZant', 'LVN', 'Technician'),
    (341, 'Georgeann Linda Vente', 'LVN', 'General'),
    (471, 'Andrea Renee Nouveau', 'RN', 'Amateur Extra')
    ;
    
This query uses GROUP BY GROUPING SETS:

SELECT COUNT(*), medical_license, radio_license
  FROM nurses
  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (medical_license, radio_license);
Output:

The first two rows show the count of RNs and LVNs (two types of nursing licenses). The NULL values in the RADIO_LICENSE column for those two rows are deliberate; the query grouped all of the LVNs together (and all the RNs together) regardless of their radio license, so the results can’t show one value in the RADIO_LICENSE column for each row that necessarily applies to all the LVNs or RNs grouped in that row.

The next three rows show the number of nurses with each type of ham radio license (“Technician”, “General”, and “Amateur Extra”). The NULL value for MEDICAL_LICENSE in each of those three rows is deliberate because no single medical license necessarily applies to all members of each of those rows.

+----------+-----------------+---------------+
| COUNT(*) | MEDICAL_LICENSE | RADIO_LICENSE |
|----------+-----------------+---------------|
|        3 | LVN             | NULL          |
|        1 | RN              | NULL          |
|        2 | NULL            | Technician    |
|        1 | NULL            | General       |
|        1 | NULL            | Amateur Extra |
+----------+-----------------+---------------+
The next example shows what happens when some columns contain NULL values. Start by adding three new nurses who don’t yet have ham radio licenses.

INSERT INTO nurses
    (ID, full_name, medical_license, radio_license)
  VALUES
    (101, 'Lily Vine', 'LVN', NULL),
    (102, 'Larry Vancouver', 'LVN', NULL),
    (172, 'Rhonda Nova', 'RN', NULL)
    ;
Then run the same query as before:

SELECT COUNT(*), medical_license, radio_license
  FROM nurses
  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (medical_license, radio_license);
Output:

The first 5 lines are the same as in the previous query.

The last line might be confusing at first – why is there a line that has NULL in both columns? And if all the values are NULL, why is the COUNT(*) equal to 3?

The answer is that the NULL in the RADIO_LICENSE column of that row occurs because three nurses don’t have any radio license. (“SELECT DISTINCT RADIO_LICENSE FROM nurses” now returns four distinct values: “Technician”, “General”, “Amateur Extra”, and “NULL”.)

The NULL in the MEDICAL_LICENSES column occurs for the same reason that NULL values occur in the earlier query results: the nurses counted in this row have different MEDICAL_LICENSES, so no one value (“RN” or “LVN”) necessarily applies to all of the nurses counted in this row.

+----------+-----------------+---------------+
| COUNT(*) | MEDICAL_LICENSE | RADIO_LICENSE |
|----------+-----------------+---------------|
|        5 | LVN             | NULL          |
|        2 | RN              | NULL          |
|        2 | NULL            | Technician    |
|        1 | NULL            | General       |
|        1 | NULL            | Amateur Extra |
|        3 | NULL            | NULL          |
+----------+-----------------+---------------+
If you’d like, you can compare this output to the output of a GROUP BY without the GROUPING SETS clause:

SELECT COUNT(*), medical_license, radio_license
  FROM nurses
  GROUP BY medical_license, radio_license;
Output:

+----------+-----------------+---------------+
| COUNT(*) | MEDICAL_LICENSE | RADIO_LICENSE |
|----------+-----------------+---------------|
|        2 | LVN             | Technician    |
|        1 | LVN             | General       |
|        1 | RN              | Amateur Extra |
|        2 | LVN             | NULL          |
|        1 | RN              | NULL          |
+----------+-----------------+---------------+
