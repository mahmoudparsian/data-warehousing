# Data Modeling

------

## 1. What It Is: 

	1. Data modeling creates a structure for data 
	in a database, such as tables, columns, and 
	their relationships.
	
	2. Data modeling is the process of creating a 
	visual representation of data structures, 
	relationships, and  attributes  within  a 
	system, essentially acting as a blueprint 
	for how data is  organized,  stored,  and 
	accessed, allowing for easier understanding, 
	management,  and analysis  of information 
	within an organization or application.

## 2. Why Itâ€™s Important: 

	It ensures data is accurate, consistent, and 
	easy to use, while also improving database 
	efficiency and scalability.

## 3. Key Steps:

1. **Identify Entities**: Determine what objects (e.g., customers, products) will be stored.

2. **Define Attributes**: Specify characteristics (e.g., name, date of birth) of entities.

3. **Set Relationships**: Define how entities are connected (e.g., customers place orders).

4. **Add Constraints**: Establish rules (e.g., unique IDs for customers).
