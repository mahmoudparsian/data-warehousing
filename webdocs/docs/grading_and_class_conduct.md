# Grading and Class Conduct Policies

## Plagiarism

		Plagiarism is the act of taking 
		someone else's ideas, words, or 
		work and presenting them as your 
		own without giving proper credit. 

		You can get help from anyone and 
		any resource to understands how 
		to solve your assignments.  But, 
		when you  submit  your  solution, 
		the solution has to be yours and 
		yours only, you may not copy 
		any solution from anywhere.
		
		Plagiarism is not accepted at all
		and will not be tolerated and will 
		be reported to the SCU authorities.

  in doubt, direct your questions to the professor.

  purpose for an assignment.  While the instructor will 
  establish the intent of an assignment, each student must 
  clarify outstanding questions of that intent for a 
  given assignment.

* The student may not give or get any unauthorized or 
  excessive assistance in the preparation of any work.

* The student must clearly establish authorship of a work. 
  Referenced work must be clearly documented, cited, and
