# Data Warehousing

## Course Description:

* This course is about data warehousing and 
its role in carrying out modern business 
intelligence for actionable insight to address 
new business needs.

* What is a data warehouse? A data warehouses 
is the central component of a modern data stack: 
a modern data stack is a combination of various 
software tools used to collect, process, and 
store data on a well-integrated cloud-based data 
platform.  

* Data warehouses have solved the problem of 
analyzing massive amounts of structured, 
semi-structured, and non-structured data and are 
cost-effective, performant and easy to use. Note 
that non-structured (such as images and log data) 
data can not be analyzed directly by SQL.

* Data warehouses are the foundation for reporting, 
ad hoc analysis, business intelligence and machine 
learning, and enable collaboration among a diversity 
of users and stakeholders across organizations 
of all sizes.

* This class will provide students with the 
conceptual background and **hands on** data analytics 
skills needed to utilize a data warehouse effectively. 
Throughout the course, students will work on an 
end-to-end development project, building a working 
data platform for **New York City Transit Data**. 
Using actual taxi, rideshare, bike share and 
weather data, students will answer real-world 
analytics questions, such as "How does location 
and time of day affect trip length?" and "How 
does weather affect transit preferences?". 
By the end, students will be empowered with the 
skills, tools and techniques needed to take a 
real-world data project from problem statement 
to prototype to production.
