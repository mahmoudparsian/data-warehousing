# Data Warehousing

## 1. Course Information

	1. A data warehouse is a  
	
	   1) subject-oriented, 
	   2) integrated,
	   3) non-volatile, and 
	   4) time-variant 
	   
	   collection of data in support 
	   of managementâ€™s decisions.

	2. This data-warehousing course introduces the  business,
	   technology, and managerial issues related  to  BI  and
	   DW solutions.   Students will acquire practical skills
	   in    collecting   business   requirements,  planning,
	   defining,  designing  and  developing  a  BI solution.
	
	3. Emphasis  is placed on learning how to derive business
	   value from BI and  DW solutions.  Hands-on  experience
	   will  be obtained  by building a small  data-warehouse
	   and using a variety of BI tools.

	4. This course is  about  data  warehousing  and its role
	   in  carrying  out  modern  business  intelligence  for
	   actionable  insight  to  address  new  business needs.
	   
	5. A data warehouses is the central component of a modern
	   data  stack (a modern  data stack  is a combination of
	   various software tools  used to collect, process,  and
	   store  data  on a  well integrated  cloud  based  data
	   platform).

## 2. Course Description:

	1. This course is about data warehousing and
	   its role in carrying out modern business
	   intelligence for actionable insight to address
	   new business needs.

	2. What is a data warehouse? A data warehouses
	   is the central component of a modern data stack:
	   a modern data stack is a combination of various
	   software tools used to collect, process, and
	   store data on a well-integrated cloud-based data
	   platform.

	3. Data warehouses have solved the problem of
	   analyzing massive amounts of structured,
	   semi-structured, and non-structured data and are
	   cost-effective, performant and easy to use. Note
	   that non-structured (such as images and log data)
	   data can not be analyzed directly by SQL.

	4. Data warehouses are the foundation for reporting,
	   ad hoc analysis, business intelligence and machine
	   learning, and enable collaboration among a diversity
	   of users and stakeholders across organizations
	   of all sizes.

	5. This class will provide students with the
	   conceptual background and **hands on** data 
	   analytics skills needed to utilize a data 
	   warehouse effectively.  Throughout the course,
	   students will work on an end-to-end development
	   project, building a working data platform for 
	   **New York City Transit Data**.  Using actual taxi,
	   rideshare, bike share and weather data, students 
	   will answer real-world analytics questions, such 
	   as "How does location and time of day affect trip
	   length?" and "How does weather affect transit
	   preferences?".

	6. By the end, students will be empowered with the
	   skills, tools and techniques needed to take a
	   real-world data project from problem statement
	   to prototype to production.
