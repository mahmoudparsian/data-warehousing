can you provide a star schema in mysql with sample records for all tables and then provide 4 examples (simple to complex) of a "slice" operation in sql
Sure, let's start by defining a simple star schema in MySQL. A star schema consists of a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables. Here's an example involving a retail store scenario:

Star Schema
Fact Table: Sales

sale_id	date	product_id	store_id	customer_id	quantity	total_amount
1	2025-02-20	1001	200	3000	2	40.00
2	2025-02-21	1002	201	3001	1	25.00
Dimension Table: Products

product_id	product_name	category	price
1001	Widget A	Widgets	20.00
1002	Widget B	Widgets	25.00
Dimension Table: Stores

store_id	store_name	location
200	Store A	Downtown
201	Store B	Uptown
Dimension Table: Customers

customer_id	customer_name	membership_level
3000	John Doe	Gold
3001	Jane Smith	Silver
Slice Operation Examples
Simple Slice - Sales on a specific date

sql
SELECT * FROM Sales
WHERE date = '2025-02-20';
This query retrieves all sales data for February 20, 2025.

Intermediate Slice - Sales of a specific product

sql
SELECT * FROM Sales
WHERE product_id = 1001;
This query retrieves all sales data for "Widget A".

Complex Slice - Sales from a specific store and product category

sql
SELECT s.*
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN Stores t ON s.store_id = t.store_id
WHERE t.store_name = 'Store A' AND p.category = 'Widgets';
This query retrieves all sales data from "Store A" for products in the "Widgets" category.

Advanced Slice - Sales for a specific customer with a certain membership level

sql
SELECT s.*
FROM Sales s
JOIN Customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.membership_level = 'Gold';
This query retrieves all sales data for customers with the "Gold" membership level.
