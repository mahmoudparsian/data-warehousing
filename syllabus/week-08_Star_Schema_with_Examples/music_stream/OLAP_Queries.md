#### 31. Find users (by `user_id` and `user_name`), who have NOT played any music.

We use a `LEFT JOIN` between the `users` and `plays` 
tables and filter out users whose `user_id` appears 
in the plays table. 

Hereâ€™s the SQL query to achieve that:

~~~sql
SELECT u.user_id, 
       u.user_name
FROM 
     users u
LEFT JOIN 
     plays p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE 
     p.user_id IS NULL;
~~~

#### Explanation:

* We perform a LEFT JOIN on the users table with 
  the plays table using the `user_id` column.

* If a user has played any music, their `user_id` 
  will exist in the plays table.

* Users who haven't played any music will have 
  NULL values in the plays table after the join.

* The WHERE `p.user_id IS NULL` condition ensures 
that only those users are selected.

------

#### 32. Find songs, where no one has played that music.

We can use a `LEFT JOIN` between the `songs` 
and `plays` tables to find songs that have never 
been played. 

Hereâ€™s the SQL query to achieve that:

~~~sql
SELECT s.song_id, 
       s.title, 
       s.artist
FROM 
     songs s
LEFT JOIN 
     plays p ON s.song_id = p.song_id
WHERE 
     p.song_id IS NULL;
~~~

#### Explanation:

* We perform a LEFT JOIN on the songs table 
  with the plays table using the `song_id` column.

* If a song has been played, its song_id will exist 
  in the plays table.

* Songs that haven't been played will have NULL 
  values in the plays table after the join.

* The `WHERE p.song_id IS NULL` condition filters 
  out songs that have been played, leaving only 
  those that havenâ€™t.

##  Questions for YouNow that youâ€™ve gotten the hang of SQL joins, 
itâ€™s your turn to put those skills to the test.
There are 3 questions for you to tackle using 
the tables and data from our case study. Hereâ€™s 
your chance to show off what youâ€™ve learned!### Q8: Can you figure out how many songs from each genre have been enjoyed by users?
	Hereâ€™s a hint to get you started: Dive into the 
	â€˜songsâ€™ and â€˜playsâ€™ tables and link them using 
	the â€˜song_idâ€™. Then, group the results by genre 
	with the GROUP BY clause and count them up with 
	the COUNT function. This will give you a clear
	picture of the musical diversity our users are 
	exploring.
	### Q9: Whoâ€™s been listening to tunes that stretch beyond 200 seconds?
	Hereâ€™s how you can find out: Bring together the 
	â€˜usersâ€™, â€˜playsâ€™, and â€˜songsâ€™ tables by joining 
	them on â€˜user_idâ€™ and â€˜song_idâ€™. Use the WHERE 
	clause to sift through the tracks based on their    
	â€˜durationâ€™. This will help you identify the users 
	who have a taste for longer jams.
