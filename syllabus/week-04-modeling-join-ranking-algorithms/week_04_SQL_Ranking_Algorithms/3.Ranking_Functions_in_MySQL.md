# MySQL Ranking Functions

# 1. Introduction

	1. The ranking functions in MySQL are  
	   used to rank each row of a partition. 

	2. The ranking functions are also part 
	   of MySQL windows functions list.

	3. These functions are always used with 
	   `OVER()` clause.

	4. The ranking functions always assign 
	   rank on basis of ORDER BY clause.

	5. The rank is assigned to rows in a 
	   sequential manner.

	6. The assignment of rank to rows always 
	   start with 1 for every new partition.


There are 3 types of ranking functions supported in MySQL-

1. `dense_rank()`
2. `rank()`
3. `percent_rank()`


## `dense_rank()`: 

	1. This function will assign rank to each 
	   row within a partition without gaps. 
	
	2. Basically, the ranks are assigned in 
	   a consecutive manner i.e if there is 
	   a tie between values then they will 
	   be assigned the same rank, and next 
	   rank value will be one greater than 
	   the previous rank assigned.

## `rank()`

	1. This function will assign rank to each 
	   row within a partition with gaps. Here, 
	   ranks are assigned in a non-consecutive 
	   manner i.e 
	
	2. if there is a tie between values then 
	   they will be assigned same rank, and 
	   next rank value will be previous rank + 
	   no of peers (duplicates).

## `percent_rank()`

	1. It returns the percentile rank of 
	   a row within a partition that ranges 
	   from 0.0 to 1.0 
	
	2. It tells the percentage of partition 
	   values less than the value in the current 
	   row, excluding the highest value.


## Examples...


	In order to understand these functions 
	in a better way. 

	Let consider a table “result”:

~~~text
SELECT * FROM result;

name      subjects   mark
------    --------   -----
Pratibha  Maths      100
Ankita    Science     80
Swarna    English    100
Ankita    Maths       65
Pratibha  Science     80
Swarna    Science     50
Pratibha  English     70
Swarna    Maths       85
Ankita    English     90
~~~


Queries:


## `dense_rank()` function:

~~~sql
SELECT subjects, name, mark, 
dense_rank() OVER ( partition by subjects 
                    order by mark desc 
                  ) AS 'dense_rank' 
FROM result;
~~~

Output-Explanation-

	1. Here, table is partitioned on the basis 
	   of “subjects”.

	2. `order by` clause is used to arrange 
	   rows of each partition in descending 
	   order by “mark”.

	3. `dense_rank()` is used to rank students 
	   in each subject.

	4. Note, for science subject there is a tie 
	   between Ankita and Pratibha, so they both 
	   are assigned same rank. The next rank value 
	   is incremented by 1 i.e 2  for Swarna.

~~~text
subjects    name       mark    dense_rank
--------    ---------  ----    ----------
English     Swarna     100     1
English     Ankita      90     2
English     Pratibha    70     3
Maths       Pratibha   100     1
Maths       Swarna      85     2
Maths       Ankita      65     3
Science     Ankita      80     1
Science     Pratibha    80     1
Science     Swarna      50     2
~~~

## `rank()` function:

~~~sql
SELECT subjects, name, mark, 
       rank() OVER ( 
                    partition by subjects 
                    order by mark desc 
                   ) AS 'rank' 
FROM result;
~~~

Output-Explanation-

	1. It’s output is similar to 
	   `dense_rank()` function.

	2. Except, that for Science subject 
	in case of a tie between Ankita and Pratibha, 
	the next rank value is incremented by 2 i.e 3 
	for Swarna.

~~~text
subjects    name       mark    rank
--------    -------    ----    -----
English    Swarna       100    1
English    Ankita        90    2
English    Pratibha      70    3
Maths      Pratibha     100    1
Maths      Swarna        85    2
Maths      Ankita        65    3
Science    Ankita        80    1
Science    Pratibha      80    1
Science    Swarna        50    3
~~~

## `percent_rank()` function:

~~~sql
SELECT subjects, name, mark, 
       percent_rank()  OVER ( 
                              partition by subjects 
                              order by mark 
                             ) AS 'percent_rank' 
FROM result;
~~~

Output-Explanation:

	1. Here, the `percent_rank()` function 
	   calculate percentile rank in ascending 
	   order by “mark” column.

	2. `percent_rank` is calculated using 
	   following formula-

			(rank - 1) / (rows - 1)

	3. `rank` is the rank of each row of the 
	   partition resulted using `rank()` function.

	4. `rows` represent the no of rows in that partition.


To understand this formula, consider following query-

~~~sql
SELECT subjects, name, mark, 
       rank() OVER ( partition by subjects order by mark )-1 AS 'rank-1', 
       count(*) over (partition by subjects)-1 AS 'total_rows-1', 
       percent_rank() OVER ( partition by subjects order by mark ) AS 'percenr_rank'
FROM result;
~~~

Output:

~~~text-
subjects  name        mark  rank-1  total_rows-1  percent_rank
--------  ---------   ----  ------  ------------  ------------
English   Pratibha    70    0       2             0.0
English   Ankita      90    1       2             0.5
English   Swarna     100    2       2             1.0
Maths     Ankita      65    0       2             0.0
Maths     Swarna      85    1       2             0.5

## Introduction to MySQL `DENSE_RANK` function

	The `DENSE_RANK()` is a window function 
	that assigns a rank to each row within 
	a partition or result set with no gaps 
	in ranking values.

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE t (
    val INT
);

INSERT INTO t(val)
VALUES(1),(2),(2),(3),(4),(4),(5);


SELECT * FROM t;
+------+
| val  |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

Now apply `DENSE_RANK` function:


~~~sql
SELECT
    val,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY val) my_rank
FROM t;

+------+---------+
| val  | my_rank |
+------+---------+
|    1 |       1 |
|    2 |       2 |
|    2 |       2 |
|    3 |       3 |
|    4 |       4 |
|    4 |       4 |
|    5 |       5 |
+------+---------+
7 rows in set (0.01 sec)
~~~


## MySQL `DENSE_RANK()` function example

We will use the following sales table for the demonstration:

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE sales(
    sales_employee VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    fiscal_year INT NOT NULL,
    sale DECIMAL(14,2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(sales_employee,fiscal_year)
);

INSERT INTO sales(sales_employee,fiscal_year,sale)
VALUES('Bob',2016,100),
      ('Bob',2017,150),
      ('Bob',2018,200),
      ('Alice',2016,150),
      ('Alice',2017,100),
      ('Alice',2018,200),
      ('John',2016,200),
      ('John',2017,150),
      ('John',2018,250);
~~~

Output:

~~~sql
SELECT * FROM sales;
+----------------+-------------+--------+
| sales_employee | fiscal_year | sale   |
+----------------+-------------+--------+
| Alice          |        2016 | 150.00 |
| Alice          |        2017 | 100.00 |
| Alice          |        2018 | 200.00 |
| Bob            |        2016 | 100.00 |
| Bob            |        2017 | 150.00 |
| Bob            |        2018 | 200.00 |
| John           |        2016 | 200.00 |
| John           |        2017 | 150.00 |
| John           |        2018 | 250.00 |
+----------------+-------------+--------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~


	The following statement uses the 
	`DENSE_RANK()` function to rank the 
	sales employees by sale amount.

~~~sql
SELECT 
  sales_employee, 
  fiscal_year, 
  sale, 
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY fiscal_year 
    ORDER BY sale DESC
  ) sales_rank 
FROM 
  sales;
  
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
| sales_employee | fiscal_year | sale   | sales_rank |
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
| John           |        2016 | 200.00 |  1         |
| Alice          |        2016 | 150.00 |  2         |
| Bob            |        2016 | 100.00 |  3         |
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
| Bob            |        2017 | 150.00 |  1         |
| John           |        2017 | 150.00 |  1         |
| Alice          |        2017 | 100.00 |  2         |
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
| John           |        2018 | 250.00 |  1         |
| Alice          |        2018 | 200.00 |  2         |
| Bob            |        2018 | 200.00 |  2         |
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
~~~

In this example:

	1. First, the PARTITION BY clause 
	divided the result sets into partitions 
	using fiscal_year.

	2. Second, the ORDER BY clause specified 
	the order of the sales employees by sales 
	in descending order.

	3. Third, the DENSE_RANK() function is 
	applied to each partition with the order 
	of the rows specified by the ORDER BY clause.


## MySQL `ROW_NUMBER()` Function


	1. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function in MySQL 
	   is used to returns the sequential number 
	   for each row within its partition. 

	2. It is a kind of window function. 
	   The row number starts from 1 to the 
	   number of rows present in the partition.


Syntax:

	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (<partition_definition> <order_definition>)  
	


Example:
	
	1. Let us demonstrate it using an example.
	
	2. First, we are going to create a table named 
	   "Person" using the below statement:

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE Person (  
  Name varchar(45) NOT NULL,  
  Product varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,  
  Country varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,  
  Year int NOT NULL  
); 
~~~
 
Populate Table:

	Next, it is required to add values to this 
	table.  Execute the below statement:

~~~sql
INSERT INTO Person(Name, Product, Country, Year)   
VALUES 
('Stephen', 'Computer', 'USA', 2015),   
('Joseph', 'Laptop', 'India', 2016),   
('John', 'TV', 'USA', 2016),  
('Donald', 'Laptop', 'England', 2015),  
('Joseph', 'Mobile', 'India', 2015),  
('Peter', 'Mouse', 'England', 2016); 

mysql> select * from Person;
+---------+----------+---------+------+
| Name    | Product  | Country | Year |
+---------+----------+---------+------+
| Stephen | Computer | USA     | 2015 |
| Joseph  | Laptop   | India   | 2016 |
| John    | TV       | USA     | 2016 |
| Donald  | Laptop   | England | 2015 |
| Joseph  | Mobile   | India   | 2015 |
| Peter   | Mouse    | England | 2016 |
+---------+----------+---------+------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~ 

Next, execute the SELECT statement to display the records:

~~~sql
SELECT *,   
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS row_num  
FROM Person;
mysql> SELECT *,
    ->     ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS row_num
    -> FROM Person;
+---------+----------+---------+------+---------+
| Name    | Product  | Country | Year | row_num |
+---------+----------+---------+------+---------+
| Stephen | Computer | USA     | 2015 |       1 |
| Joseph  | Laptop   | India   | 2016 |       2 |
| John    | TV       | USA     | 2016 |       3 |
| Donald  | Laptop   | England | 2015 |       4 |
| Joseph  | Mobile   | India   | 2015 |       5 |
| Peter   | Mouse    | England | 2016 |       6 |
+---------+----------+---------+------+---------+
6 rows in set (0.01 sec)
~~~
The following are the basic syntax to use `ROW_NUMBER()` in MySQL:

Now, we can use the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign a 
sequence number for each record using the below statement:

~~~sql
SELECT *,   
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Year) AS row_num  
FROM Person;

mysql> SELECT *,
    ->     ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Year) AS row_num
    -> FROM Person;
+---------+----------+---------+------+---------+
| Name    | Product  | Country | Year | row_num |
+---------+----------+---------+------+---------+
| Stephen | Computer | USA     | 2015 |       1 |
| Donald  | Laptop   | England | 2015 |       2 |
| Joseph  | Mobile   | India   | 2015 |       3 |
| Joseph  | Laptop   | India   | 2016 |       1 |
| John    | TV       | USA     | 2016 |       2 |
| Peter   | Mouse    | England | 2016 |       3 |
+---------+----------+---------+------+---------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)  
~~~

NOTE:

	It will give the output as below where 
	two partitions found based on the year 
	(2015 and 2016).


# Twitter Example:

~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE twitter;
USE twitter;

CREATE TABLE twitter_comments (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  likes INT,
  published_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

* What we want to do: 

given we have a list of tweets, we 
want to find SUM of the latest comments 
(only 3 latest items) for each user.

~~~sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  SUM(likes)
  FROM (
        SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() 
          OVER( PARTITION BY user_id 
                ORDER BY published_at DESC 
              ) 
          AS `rank`
        FROM twitter_comments
        ORDER BY user_id ASC, published_at DESC
       ) AS data
  WHERE `rank` <= 3
 GROUP BY user_id;
~~~

### Analyze INNER QUERY:

	1. For each user's tweet, we generate a unique 
	   row number, which is later used to limit rows 
	   with aggregation functions(like SUM or AVG)

	2. The intermediate result (with rank for each 
	   tweet per user) looks like this:

~~~
mysql> SELECT *,
    ->         ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY user_id 
    ->                            ORDER BY published_at DESC 
    ->                          ) AS `rank`
    ->         FROM twitter_comments
    ->         ORDER BY user_id ASC, published_at DESC;

# `ROW_NUMBER()` Function Example

	1. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function in MySQL 
	   assigns a unique integer value to 
	   each row in the result set. 

	2. This assigned number is determined by 
	   the order in which rows appear in 
	   the query result. 
	   
	3. It's important to note that `ROW_NUMBER()` 
	   does not directly modify the table data but 
	   is rather a means to generate a ranking for 
	   each row within the result set.

Here is the basic syntax of the `ROW_NUMBER()` function:

	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column_name)

`ROW_NUMBER()`: The function itself.

* OVER: A clause that specifies the window frame for the function.

* `(ORDER BY column_name)`: The column by which the 
   rows will be ordered to assign the row numbers.

* PARTITION BY

NOTE:
		While `ROW_NUMBER()` can be used on its own to 
		assign a sequential number to each row in the 
		result set, combining it with the PARTITION BY 
		clause allows you to reset the numbering for 
		each distinct value in a specified column. 

		This is particularly useful when you want to 
		GROUP your data into partitions and assign 
		row numbers within those partitions.

Here is the basic syntax of `ROW_NUMBER()` with PARTITION BY:

	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY column_name)

	PARTITION BY partition_column: Specifies the  
	column by which to partition the result set. 
	
	The ROW_NUMBER() function will reset the numbering 
	for each unique value in this column.

	ORDER BY column_name: Determines the order within 
	each partition, which is used to assign row numbers.


## Real-World Example: Document Versioning

	1. Let's take a real-world example to illustrate 
	   the use of `ROW_NUMBER()` over PARTITION BY. 

	2. Consider a scenario where you have a database 
	   table called document_versions, which stores 
	   multiple versions of documents.

The document_versions table has the following structure:

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE `document_versions` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `document_id` int NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
~~~

The data in the document_versions table looks like this:

~~~text
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+
| id | document_id | name          | created_at          |
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+
|  1 |           1 | document1.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:07:19 |
|  2 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:08:19 |
|  3 |           1 | document1.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:10:19 |
|  4 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:12:19 |
|  5 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:14:19 |
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+
~~~

	1. Each document has a unique `document_id`, 

	2. and you want to assign a version number to 
	   each version within the context of its 
	   associated document. 

Here's how you can achieve this using `ROW_NUMBER()` and `PARTITION BY`:

~~~sql
SELECT
    id,
    document_id,
    name,
    created_at,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY document_id ORDER BY created_at
    ) AS version_number
FROM
    document_versions;
~~~

In this SQL query:

	1. We select the id, document_id, created_at 
	   and name columns from the document_versions table.

	2. We use the `ROW_NUMBER()` function with 
	   `PARTITION BY` document_id to partition 
	    the result set by the document_id column. 

	3. This ensures that the numbering starts fresh 
	   for each unique document.

	4. We specify the ORDER BY created_at clause to 
	   determine the order of versions within each 
	   document, which will be used for assigning 
	   version numbers. 
	
	5. The oldest version will get the lowest number, 
	   the newest version will get the highest number.

Running the query results in the following output:

~~~sql
SELECT
    id,
    document_id,
    name,
    created_at,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY document_id ORDER BY created_at
    ) AS version_number
FROM
    document_versions
ORDER BY
    created_at;
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------+
| id | document_id | name          | created_at          | version_number |
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------+
|  1 |           1 | document1.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:07:19 |              1 |
|  2 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:08:19 |              1 |
|  3 |           1 | document1.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:10:19 |              2 |
|  4 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:12:19 |              2 |
|  5 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:14:19 |              3 |
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

Even if you change the ordering of the result set, 
the version numbers will remain the same:

~~~sql
SELECT
    id,
    document_id,
    name,
    created_at,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY document_id ORDER BY created_at
    ) AS version_number
FROM
    document_versions
ORDER BY
     name, created_at;
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------+
| id | document_id | name          | created_at          | version_number |
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------+
|  1 |           1 | document1.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:07:19 |              1 |
|  3 |           1 | document1.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:10:19 |              2 |
|  2 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:08:19 |              1 |
|  4 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:12:19 |              2 |
|  5 |           2 | document2.pdf | 2023-09-13 18:14:19 |              3 |
+----+-------------+---------------+---------------------+----------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

## Conclusion

	1. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function combined with 
	   the `PARTITION BY` clause in MySQL is a 
	   powerful tool for assigning row numbers 
	   within partitions of data. 

	2. This construct is particularly valuable when 
	   you need to rank or sequence data within specific 
	   groups or categories. 
	   
	3. In our real-world example of document versioning, 
	   it allowed us to easily assign version numbers to 
	   each version of a document within the context of 
	   that document. 

	4. By mastering this SQL construct, you can unlock 
	   new possibilities for analyzing and organizing 
	   your data in MySQL databases.

# Rank students based on their average in MySQL

	I have been researching and trying various 
	queries to get this to work. What I want to 
	happen is to rank each student based on their 
	average which will be calculated by using 
	AVG(grade) and this will be grouped by student_id. 
	
	The table with the necessary info is as follows:

		assessment_id | student_id | grade | subject_id

What I would like to see after the query is:

	student_id | AVG(grade) | rank


~~~sql
SELECT student_id, AVG(grade) as average, 
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(grade) DESC) AS student_rank
FROM grades
GROUP BY student_id
~~~


# Rankings with SQL: A Complete Example

Scenario

	1. Assume that you are developing an online 
	   game like QuizUp, and it allows users to 
	   register and play the game. 
	
	2. A registered user can participate in 
	   quizzes under topics. 
	
	3. A user will score every time plays a quiz, 
	   but only the highest score will be taken 
	   into account when ranking. 
	
	4. The users will be ranked within each topic, 
	   and, under a particular topic, users will be 
	   further ranked under country too. 
	
	For example, 
		if you are playing the game under topic 
		‘Databases’ then you will have a rank 
		for Database topic (a global rank among 
		all the users who have played this topic), 
		and a rank within the country you play 
		(assuming you are in the US, and you will 
		have a country rank or continent/globa rank).

	5. In the dashboard (or app), all users who at 
	   least once participated in a quiz under a 
	   particular topic will be shown in the topic 
	   leaderboard. Something like this.

Our Schema

	1. Let’s keep the schema simple for this example. 
	   We have only one table called, scores. 
	   
	2. And it has the recorded scores for each user 
	   every time he/she played a quiz, and for the 
	   convenience, we assume that against each user 
	   we have his/her country as well, based on the 
	   logged-in country at the time of play or account 
	   information given in advance. 
	
	3. The below table shows a sample set of data we 
	   will be going to rank under the topic id, 101.

~~~sql
mysql> select * from scores;
+---------+------------+----------+-------+
| user_id | country_id | topic_id | score |
+---------+------------+----------+-------+
|       4 | US         |      101 |    72 |
|       3 | CAN        |      101 |    30 |
|       6 | US         |      101 |    72 |
|       4 | US         |      101 |    49 |
|       1 | CAN        |      101 |    53 |
|       8 | US         |      101 |    67 |
|       5 | CAN        |      101 |     6 |
|       7 | CAN        |      101 |    87 |
|       2 | US         |      101 |    41 |
|       3 | CAN        |      101 |    76 |
|       9 | GER        |      101 |    87 |

## Step 1: Aggregate

	First, let's aggregate all the scores per 
	user and team. So, that we will have the highest 
	score for each user against his/her country.

~~~sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  country_id,
  MAX(score) AS high_score
FROM scores
WHERE topic_id = 101
GROUP BY user_id, country_id
~~~

MySQL run:

~~~sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   user_id,
    ->   country_id,
    ->   MAX(score) AS high_score
    -> FROM scores
    -> WHERE topic_id = 101
    -> GROUP BY user_id, country_id;
+---------+------------+------------+
| user_id | country_id | high_score |
+---------+------------+------------+
|       4 | US         |         72 |
|       3 | CAN        |         76 |
|       6 | US         |         72 |
|       1 | CAN        |         53 |
|       8 | US         |         67 |
|       5 | CAN        |          6 |
|       7 | CAN        |         87 |
|       2 | US         |         41 |
|       9 | GER        |         89 |
+---------+------------+------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

	NOTES:
		1. We have used country_id for grouping 
		because when we’re going to do the ranking, 
		we need to have the country_id field for 
		the parent query. 
		
		2. Also, if the game rules have changed 
		to take total score instead of the highest 
		score, simply, only we have to change the 
		aggregate function from MAX to SUM.
		

## Step 2: Rankings

		Now we want to get the rank of each user 
		relative to each country the user belongs to. 
		
		The expected result should look like below.
	
~~~sql
SELECT
  t.user_id,
  t.country_id,
  t.high_score,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY t.country_id 
               ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) 
               AS country_rank
FROM (
        SELECT
          user_id,
          country_id,
          MAX(score) AS high_score
        FROM scores
        WHERE topic_id = 101
        GROUP BY user_id, country_id
     ) AS t
ORDER BY t.country_id DESC, country_rank;
~~~

MySQL run:

~~~sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   t.user_id,
    ->   t.country_id,
    ->   t.high_score,
    ->   RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY t.country_id
    ->                ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) 
    ->        AS country_rank
    -> FROM (
    ->         SELECT
    ->           user_id,

    ->         FROM scores
    ->         WHERE topic_id = 101
    ->         GROUP BY user_id, country_id
    ->      ) AS t
    -> ORDER BY t.country_id DESC, country_rank;
+---------+------------+------------+--------------+
| user_id | country_id | high_score | country_rank |
+---------+------------+------------+--------------+
|       4 | US         |         72 |            1 |
|       6 | US         |         72 |            1 |
|       8 | US         |         67 |            3 |
|       2 | US         |         41 |            4 |
|       9 | GER        |         89 |            1 |
|       7 | CAN        |         87 |            1 |
|       3 | CAN        |         76 |            2 |
|       1 | CAN        |         53 |            3 |
|       5 | CAN        |          6 |            4 |
+---------+------------+------------+--------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

	NOTES: 
		Here, what we do is, we take the query in 
		Step-1 as a derived table for the new query, 
		by enclosing it inside the FROM clause. Check 
		the new projection clause.

		RANK() OVER 
			(PARTITION BY t.country_id ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) 
				AS country_rank



### `DENSE_RANK`: 
		rows within equal rank will have the same 
		rank and will have no gaps. i.e. Consider 
		three users U1, U2 and U3 having high score 
		80, 80, 78 respectively. 
		
		Using DENSE_RANK will have rankings 1, 1, 2 
		for three users.

### `RANK`: 
		rows within equal ranks will have the same 
		rank, but there can be gaps in rank values. 
		
		FOR EXAMPLE: if two users get the same ranking,
		say 4th, then the next user will be ranked 6th 
		because two users are in 4th, hence rank 5th 
		is not available.


## Getting Global Ranks

		As said earlier, assume we need to show 
		
		1. user’s global rank in the dashboard along 
		
		2. with an individual’s country rank as well. 
		
		First, let’s see the query for it.

	This is very similar to the above query 
	in Step-2, except 
	
			we REMOVED THE PARTITION CLAUSE. 
	
	What happens here is that, as soon as we removed 
	the partition clause, the query will not have any 
	partition, but only ONE PARTITION: the whole table. 
	
			but only ONE PARTITION: the whole table. 

	The only and default partition that exists for the 
	query, is the whole table. So, when the RANK is applied, 
	it calculates the rank relative to the whole table. 
	
	Hence we get the global rank. That means the query 
	will rank users regardless of the team. Here is the 
	result of the above query.


## Two Birds with One Stone

	1. In the dashboard, or from your business 
	   layer, do you really think you want to call 
	   twice to get the two rankings, and then combine 
	   for each user

				The answer is NO!

	2. You don’t really want to write two SQL queries, 
	
	2.1 one to get team ranks, and 
	
	2.2 one to get global ranks. 
	
	In fact, you can get both ranks in a single query.

	That is the beauty of window functions!

	You can have as many partitions as you want 
	on each projection clause. One partition 
	clause does not affect to other projection clauses. 
	They are totally independent.

So, the combined query should look like this.

~~~sql
SELECT
  t.user_id,
  t.country_id,
  t.high_score,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY t.country_id 
               ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) AS country_rank,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) AS global_rank
FROM (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    country_id,
    MAX(score) AS high_score
  FROM scores
  WHERE topic_id = 101
  GROUP BY user_id, country_id
) AS t;
~~~

	NOTES:
	
			Now we have the desired result with 
			output like below having calculated 
			both ranks in two columns.

### Get Both Rankings of a Single User

	You might be tempted to think that, 
	it is trivial to get the ranks of a 
	single user by filtering only the record 
	for that user id. In simpler terms, just 
	add a where clause within the condition, 
	user_id = ? before order by clause in the 
	outer query, right?

	Wrong!

	If you do so, you will NOT be able to 
	calculate rankings. For all users, it 
	will always show team rank as 1st and 
	global rank as 1st, which is obviously wrong.

	The reason for this behavior is very simple.

		In SQL world, WHERE clause gets executed 
		before the SELECT clause.

		Therefore, when the records are going 
		to be partitioning, which is inside the 
		projection, there is only one record, and 
		it is the record for the filtered users. 
		
		But to calculate rankings, we need high_score(s) 
		for every user. You can neither add the user 
		filtering inside the derived table nor the outer query.

	So, where do we put the filtering?

	Easy! Just enclose this query inside another 
	outer query, and filter out the user from enclosing 
	query. See below.

~~~sql
SELECT
    *
FROM (
  SELECT
    t.user_id,
    t.country_id,
    t.high_score,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY t.country_id 
                 ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) AS country_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY t.high_score DESC) AS global_rank
  FROM (
    SELECT
      user_id,
      country_id,
      MAX(score) AS high_score
    FROM scores
    WHERE topic_id = 101
    GROUP BY user_id, country_id
  ) AS t
) AS rt
WHERE
    rt.user_id = 8;

~~~sql

    ->     *
    -> FROM (
    ->   SELECT
    ->     t.user_id,

### Three depths of SQL Query

		Three depths of the above query show the 
		three stages of result transformation to 
		get rankings. i.e.

			1. Aggregating: aggregate results first,

			2. Ranking: then apply rankings, and

			3. Filtering: filter out the necessary output.


# MySQL `FIND_IN_SET()` Function

Search for "q" within the list of strings:

	SELECT FIND_IN_SET("q", "s,q,l")
	
Definition and Usage:

	The `FIND_IN_SET()` function returns the 
	position of a string within a list of strings.

Syntax

	FIND_IN_SET(string, string_list)

Return Values

	1. If `string` is not found in `string_list`, 
	   this function returns 0
	   
	2. If `string` or `string_list` is NULL, 
	   this function returns NULL

	3. If `string_list` is an empty string (""), 
	   this function returns 0

	Examples:
	
		FIND_IN_SET("a", "s,q,l") -> 0
		
		FIND_IN_SET("s", "s,q,l") -> 1
		
		FIND_IN_SET("q", "s,q,l") -> 2


## `FIND_IN_SET()` Example: Get the rank of a user in a score table

		I have a very simple MySQL table where 
		I save highscores. It looks like that:


		Id     Name     Score
	
	
	So far so good. The question is: 
	How do I get what's a users rank? 
	
	For example, I have a users Name or Id 
	and want to get his rank, where all rows 
	are ordinal ordered descending for the Score.

An Example

~~~text
Id  Name    Score
--  ----    -----
1   Ida     100
2   Boo     58
3   Lala    88
4   Bash    102
5   Assem   99
~~~

	NOTES:
	
		1. In this very case, Assem's rank would be 3, 
		   because he got the 3rd highest score.

		2. The query should return one row, 
		   which contains (only) the required Rank.

		3. First understand `GROUP_CONCAT`:

		GROUP_CONCAT( score ORDER BY score DESC )
		
		will return
		
		"102,100,99,88,58"
		
		FIND_IN_SET("102", "102,100,99,88,58") returns 1
		FIND_IN_SET("100", "102,100,99,88,58") returns 2
		FIND_IN_SET("99", "102,100,99,88,58")  returns 3
		FIND_IN_SET("88", "102,100,99,88,58")  returns 4
		FIND_IN_SET("58", "102,100,99,88,58")  returns 5
		
Solution:

~~~sql
SELECT id, name, score, 
       FIND_IN_SET( score, 
                    (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT( score ORDER BY score DESC ) 
                     FROM scores 
                    )
                  ) AS rank
FROM scores
~~~

gives this list:

~~~text
id name  score rank
-- ----  ----- ----
1  Ida   100   2
2  Boo    58   5
3  Lala   88   4
4  Bash  102   1
5  Assem  99   3
~~~


Getting a single person score:

~~~sql
SELECT id, name, score, 
       FIND_IN_SET( score, (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT( score ORDER BY score DESC ) 
                            FROM scores )
                  ) AS rank
FROM scores
WHERE name =  'Assem'
~~~

Gives this result:

~~~text
id name score rank
-- ---- ----- ----
5  Assem   99    3
~~~

		You'll have one scan to get the score 
		list, and another scan or seek to do 
		something useful with it. 
		
		An index on the score column would 
		help performance on large tables.

# `RANK()` vs. `DENSE_RANK()` vs. `ROW_NUMBER()`

Consider the following table: scores

~~~text
first_name   last_name  points
----------   ---------  ------
Emyr         Downes     70
Dina         Morin      70
Evie-May     Boyer      80
Nora         Parkinson  60
Trystan      Oconnor    40
Eryk         Myers      90
Marlene      Duncan     90
Marius       Powell     90
Joanne       Goddard    50
Rayhan       Williamson 90
~~~

Now consider the following SQL query:

~~~sql
SELECT
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY points DESC) AS rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY points DESC) AS dense_rank,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points DESC) AS row_number,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  points
FROM scores;
~~~

Result:

~~~text
rank  dense_rank  row_number  first_name  last_name    points
----  ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------    ------
1     1           1           Marlene     Duncan       90
1     1           2           Rayhan      Williamson   90
1     1           3           Marius      Powell       90
1     1           4           Eryk        Myers        90
5     2           5           Evie-May    Boyer        80
6     3           6           Emyr        Downes       70
6     3           7           Dina        Morin        70
8     4           8           Nora        Parkinson    60
9     5           9           Joanne      Goddard      50
10    6          10           Trystan     Oconnor      40
