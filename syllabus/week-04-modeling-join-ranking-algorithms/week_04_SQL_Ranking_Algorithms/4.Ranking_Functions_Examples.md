# Ranking Functions Examples ðŸš€

Here are six OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) 
queries using a Star Schema with subqueries, 
joins, and ranking functions (including PARTITION BY 
and QUALIFY).

* Aggregation: Using `SUM()` for total sales calculations.

* Partitioning: `PARTITION BY` is used to rank or compute over subsets.

* Ranking Functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, 
  `ROW_NUMBER()` to order data.

* QUALIFY Clause: Filters ranked results (specific to databases like Snowflake).

* Window Functions: LAG() for previous period comparisons.




## Schema Assumptions:

We assume a Star Schema with the following tables:

~~~
Fact_Sales 
  (sales_id, date_id, product_id, customer_id, store_id, sales_amount, quantity_sold)

Dim_Date 
  (date_id, year, month, day, quarter)

Dim_Product 
  (product_id, product_name, category, price)

Dim_Customer 
  (customer_id, customer_name, region, segment)

Dim_Store 
  (store_id, store_name, location)
~~~

### 1. Top 5 Products by Sales in Each Category (Using RANK and PARTITION BY)

~~~sql
SELECT product_name, category, total_sales, rank
FROM (
    SELECT 
        p.product_name,
        p.category,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(f.sales_amount) DESC) AS rank
    FROM Fact_Sales f
    JOIN Dim_Product p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY p.product_name, p.category
) sub
QUALIFY rank <= 5;
~~~

### 2. Monthly Sales Trend Per Store (Using PARTITION and Window Functions)

~~~sql
SELECT store_name, month, year, total_sales, 
       LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY store_name ORDER BY year, month) 
         AS prev_month_sales,
       (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY store_name ORDER BY year, month)) 
         AS sales_change
FROM (
    SELECT 
        s.store_name,
        d.year,
        d.month,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM Fact_Sales f
    JOIN Dim_Date d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
    JOIN Dim_Store s ON f.store_id = s.store_id
    GROUP BY s.store_name, d.year, d.month
) sub;
~~~

### 3. Top 3 Customers in Each Region by Total Purchase (Using QUALIFY and DENSE_RANK)

~~~sql
SELECT customer_name, region, total_purchase, rank
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_name,
        c.region,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_purchase,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(f.sales_amount) DESC) 
          AS rank
    FROM Fact_Sales f
    JOIN Dim_Customer c ON f.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_name, c.region
) sub
QUALIFY rank <= 3;
~~~

### 4. Sales Growth Rate Per Product Category (Using LAG and PARTITION BY)

~~~sql
SELECT category, year, total_sales, 
       LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY year) 
         AS prev_year_sales,
       (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY year)) / NULLIF(LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY year), 0) * 100 
         AS growth_rate
FROM (
    SELECT 
        p.category,
        d.year,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM Fact_Sales f
    JOIN Dim_Product p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN Dim_Date d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY p.category, d.year
) sub;
~~~

### 5. Top Store Per Region Based on Total Sales (Using ROW_NUMBER)

~~~sql
SELECT store_name, region, total_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        s.store_name,
        s.location AS region,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.location ORDER BY SUM(f.sales_amount) DESC) 
          AS row_num
    FROM Fact_Sales f
    JOIN Dim_Store s ON f.store_id = s.store_id
    GROUP BY s.store_name, s.location
) sub
QUALIFY row_num = 1;
~~~

### 6. Customer Retention Rate (Customers Who Purchased in Consecutive Years)

~~~sql
SELECT customer_name, year, 
       LAG(year) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_name ORDER BY year) AS prev_year,
       CASE 
           WHEN LAG(year) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_name ORDER BY year) IS NOT NULL THEN 'Retained'
           ELSE 'New'
       END AS retention_status
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_name,
        d.year
    FROM Fact_Sales f
    JOIN Dim_Customer c ON f.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN Dim_Date d ON f.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_name, d.year
) sub;
