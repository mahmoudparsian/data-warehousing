Explanatory Data Analysis using Python on Cars data.

This is a quick EDA excercise to find out :

1. Which type of cars are sold maximum?
2. What is the co-relation between price and mileage?
3. How many cars are registered?
4. Price distribution between registered and non-registered cars.
5. What is the car price distribution based on Engine Value?
6. Which Engine Type of cars users preferred maximum?
7. Establish corelation between all features using heatmap.
8. Distribution of Price

This is a good practice of Data Cleaning and also to understand 
the effect of ouliers in the data.
