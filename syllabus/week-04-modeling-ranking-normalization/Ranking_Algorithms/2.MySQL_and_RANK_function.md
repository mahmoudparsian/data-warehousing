# MySQL RANK Function


	Summary: in this tutorial, you will learn 
	about the MySQL RANK() function and how 
	to apply it to assign a rank to each row 
	within the partition of a result set.

	Note that MySQL has been supporting the 
	RANK() function and other window functions 
	since version 8.0

## Introduction to MySQL RANK() function

	The RANK() function assigns a rank to 
	each row within the  partition  of a 
	result set.   The rank  of a  row is 
	specified by one plus the number of 
	ranks that come before it.

The following shows the syntax of the RANK() function:

~~~mysql
RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY <expression>[{,<expression>...}]
    ORDER BY <expression> [ASC|DESC], [{,<expression>...}]
)
~~~


	1. the PARTITION BY clause divides the 
	   result sets into partitions. The RANK() 
	   function is performed within partitions 
	   and re-initialized when crossing the 
	   partition boundary.

	2. The ORDER BY clause sorts the rows 
	   within a partition by one or more columns 
	   or expressions.

	3. Unlike the ROW_NUMBER() function, the 
	   RANK() function does not always return 
	   consecutive integers.

Suppose you have a sample table as follows:

~~~sql
use test_db;

CREATE TABLE t (
    val INT
);
~~~

Then insert some rows:

~~~sql
INSERT INTO t(val)
VALUES(1),(2),(2),(3),(4),(4),(5);
~~~

Show table content:

~~~sql
SELECT * FROM t;
mysql> select * from t;
+------+
| val  |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~


	The following statement uses the RANK() 
	function to assign a rank to each row 
	from the result set in the t table:

~~~sql
SELECT
    val,
    RANK() OVER (
        ORDER BY val
    ) my_rank
FROM
    t;
~~~

Here is the output:

~~~
mysql> SELECT
    ->     val,
    ->     RANK() OVER (
    ->         ORDER BY val
    ->     ) my_rank
    -> FROM
    ->     t;
 +------+---------+
| val  | my_rank |
+------+---------+
|    1 |       1 |
|    2 |       2 |
|    2 |       2 |
|    3 |       4 |
|    4 |       5 |
|    4 |       5 |
|    5 |       7 |
+------+---------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

	NOTES:
	
		1. The output indicates that the second 
		   and third rows have the same ties so 
		   they receive the same rank 2.

		2. The fourth row has rank 4 because the 
		   RANK() function skips the rank 3.


## MySQL RANK() function example

	Let’s use the sales table created in the 
	window function tutorial for the demonstration.

If you have not created the sales table yet, here is the script:

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales(
    sales_employee VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    fiscal_year INT NOT NULL,
    sale DECIMAL(14,2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(sales_employee,fiscal_year)
);
~~~

Insert some rows:

~~~sql
INSERT INTO sales(sales_employee,fiscal_year,sale)
VALUES('Bob',2016,100),
      ('Bob',2017,150),
      ('Bob',2018,200),
      ('Alice',2016,150),
      ('Alice',2017,100),
      ('Alice',2018,200),
       ('John',2016,200),
      ('John',2017,150),
      ('John',2018,250);
~~~

Show table content:

~~~sql
SELECT * FROM sales;
+----------------+-------------+--------+
| sales_employee | fiscal_year | sale   |
+----------------+-------------+--------+
| Alice          |        2016 | 150.00 |
| Alice          |        2017 | 100.00 |
| Alice          |        2018 | 200.00 |
| Bob            |        2016 | 100.00 |
| Bob            |        2017 | 150.00 |
| Bob            |        2018 | 200.00 |
| John           |        2016 | 200.00 |
| John           |        2017 | 150.00 |
| John           |        2018 | 250.00 |
+----------------+-------------+--------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

	The following statement uses the RANK() 
	function to rank the sales employees by 
	sales amount every year:

~~~sql
SELECT
    sales_employee,
    fiscal_year,
    sale,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY
                     fiscal_year
                 ORDER BY
                     sale DESC
                ) sales_rank
FROM
    sales;
~~~

Output:

~~~
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
| sales_employee | fiscal_year | sale   | sales_rank |
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
| John           |        2016 | 200.00 |          1 |
| Alice          |        2016 | 150.00 |          2 |
| Bob            |        2016 | 100.00 |          3 |
| Bob            |        2017 | 150.00 |          1 |
| John           |        2017 | 150.00 |          1 |
| Alice          |        2017 | 100.00 |          3 |
| John           |        2018 | 250.00 |          1 |
| Alice          |        2018 | 200.00 |          2 |
| Bob            |        2018 | 200.00 |          2 |
+----------------+-------------+--------+------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

In this example:

	1. the PARTITION BY clause breaks 
	   the result sets into partitions 
	   by fiscal year.

	2. Then, the ORDER BY clause sorts 
	   the sales employees by sales in 
	   descending order.


## MySQL RANK() function with CTE example

	The following statement uses the RANK() 
	function to find the top three highest 
	valued orders in each year:

~~~sql
WITH order_values AS(
    SELECT 
        orderNumber, 
        YEAR(orderDate) order_year,
        quantityOrdered*priceEach AS order_value,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY YEAR(orderDate)
            ORDER BY quantityOrdered*priceEach DESC
        ) order_value_rank
    FROM
        orders
    INNER JOIN orderdetails USING (orderNumber)
)
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    order_values
WHERE 
    order_value_rank <=3;
~~~

Here is the output:

~~~sql
+-------------+------------+-------------+------------------+
| orderNumber | order_year | order_value | order_value_rank |
+-------------+------------+-------------+------------------+
|       10196 |       2003 |     9571.08 |                1 |
|       10206 |       2003 |     9568.73 |                2 |
|       10201 |       2003 |     9394.28 |                3 |
|       10312 |       2004 |    10286.40 |                1 |
|       10348 |       2004 |     9974.40 |                2 |
|       10304 |       2004 |     9467.68 |                3 |
|       10403 |       2005 |    11503.14 |                1 |
|       10405 |       2005 |    11170.52 |                2 |
|       10407 |       2005 |    10723.60 |                3 |
+-------------+------------+-------------+------------------+
9 rows in set (0.01 sec)
~~~

In this example:

	1. use a common table expression (CTE) 
	   to get the order number, order year, 
	   and rank. To rank orders by order value 
	   in each year, we used the RANK() function 
	   that partitioned the rows by order year 
	   and sorted the order value in descending order.

	2. Then, select only the orders whose rank is 
	   less than or equal to three.

## Summary

	Use the MySQL RANK() function to assign 
	a rank to each row in a result set.
