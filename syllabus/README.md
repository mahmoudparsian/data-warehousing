	Bill Inmon, known as the "Father 
        of Data Warehousing", defines a data 
	warehouse (DW) as a collection of 
        data that is: 

	1. Subject-oriented: 
               Focuses on a specific area, such as 
	       sales, marketing, or distribution 

	2. Integrated: 
               Combines different data types 
	       from various sources 

	3. Non-volatile: 
               Stable and doesn't change 
	       once entered into the DW 

	4. Time-variant: 
               Analyzes changes over time, 
	       and typically contains multiple 
	       years of data
