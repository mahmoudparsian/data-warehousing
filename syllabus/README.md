## Definition of a Data Warehousing

	     Bill Inmon, known as the "Father 
	     of Data Warehousing",  defines a 
	     data warehouse (DW) as a collection 
	     of data that is: 


| Data Warehouse feature    | Description  |
| ------------------------- | -------------|
| 1. **Subject-oriented**:  | Focuses on a specific area, such as sales, marketing, or distribution |
| 2. **Integrated**:        | Combines different data types from various sources |
| 3. **Non-volatile**:      | Stable and doesn't change once entered into the DW |
| 4. **Time-variant**:      | Analyzes changes over time, and typically contains multiple years of data |
