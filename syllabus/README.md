# Syllabus


	Bill Inmon, known as the "Father of Data Warehousing", 
	defines a data warehouse (DW) as a collection of data 
	that is: 

	1. Subject-oriented: Focuses on a specific area, 
	   such as sales, marketing, or distribution 

	2. Integrated: Combines different data types from 
	   various sources 

	3. Non-volatile: Stable and doesn't change once 
	   entered into the DW 

	4. Time-variant: Analyzes changes over time, and 
	   typically contains multiple years of data
