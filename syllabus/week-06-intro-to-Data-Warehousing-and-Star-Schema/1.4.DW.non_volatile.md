# data warehouse is "non-volatile"

	When we say that a data warehouse is "non-volatile," 
	it means that once data is entered into the data 
	warehouse, it is not typically changed or deleted. 
	This characteristic ensures that the data remains 
	stable over time, providing a reliable and consistent 
	historical record for analysis and reporting.

### Characteristics of a Non-Volatile Data Warehouse:

1. **Stable Data**: Data in the warehouse is stable and not subject to frequent changes. Unlike transactional databases where data is continuously updated, a data warehouse preserves the historical state of data.

2. **Append-Only**: New data is usually added to the data warehouse without altering or deleting existing data. This append-only nature ensures that historical data remains intact.

3. **Historical Records**: Non-volatility ensures that historical records are preserved, allowing for accurate trend analysis and historical reporting.

4. **Data Integrity**: The non-volatile nature of a data warehouse enhances data integrity by preventing accidental or intentional alterations that could compromise the accuracy of historical data.

5. **Data Archiving**: Data is often archived rather than deleted, ensuring that historical data is available for long-term analysis and compliance purposes.

### Example

Consider a sales data warehouse where sales transactions are stored:

- When a new sales transaction occurs, it is added to the data warehouse.
- Historical sales transactions are not modified or deleted, preserving an accurate record of past sales.
- Users can query the data warehouse to analyze sales trends over time, confident that the historical data has not been altered.

### Benefits of Non-Volatile Data Warehouses

- **Reliable Analysis**: Users can rely on the stability of the data for accurate analysis, reporting, and decision-making.
- **Historical Accuracy**: Historical data remains accurate and unaltered, which is crucial for trend analysis and understanding long-term patterns.
- **Data Integrity**: The integrity of the data is maintained, reducing the risk of data corruption or loss.
- **Compliance**: Non-volatile data warehouses support compliance with regulatory requirements that mandate the retention of historical data.

### Conclusion

Non-volatility is a key characteristic of data warehouses that ensures data remains stable and unaltered once it is entered. This stability provides a reliable foundation for historical analysis, reporting, and decision-making, ensuring that users can trust the accuracy and integrity of the data over time.
