### LAG() function 

The `LAG()` function in MySQL is a window function that provides access to a row at a given physical offset that comes before the current row within the result set. It is commonly used for comparing values between rows, such as computing differences between consecutive rows.

### Syntax

```sql
LAG(value_expression, offset, default_value) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    ORDER BY sort_expression
)
```

- `value_expression`: The column or expression whose value you want to access from a preceding row.
- `offset`: The number of rows back from the current row from which to obtain a value. The default value is 1 if not specified.
- `default_value`: The value to return if the offset goes beyond the scope of the window. The default value is NULL if not specified.
- `PARTITION BY partition_expression`: Divides the result set into partitions to which the function is applied. This is optional.
- `ORDER BY sort_expression`: Specifies the order of the rows within each partition.

### Example

Suppose we have a table `sales` with the following schema and data:

```sql name=sales.sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sales_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sales_date DATE,
    sales_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO sales (sales_id, sales_date, sales_amount) VALUES
(1, '2025-01-01', 1000.00),
(2, '2025-01-02', 1500.00),
(3, '2025-01-03', 2000.00),
(4, '2025-01-04', 1800.00),
(5, '2025-01-05', 2200.00);
```

### Query Using LAG()

The `LAG()` is used in Query-9.

What are `LEAD()` and `LAG()` Functions in MySQL?

		The LAG() function is used to get value 
		from the row that **precedes the current row**.

		The LEAD() function is used to get value 
		from a row that **succeeds the current row**.

Syntax: 

	LAG(expr, N, default) 
          OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)

	LEAD(expr, N, default) 
          OVER (Window_specification | Window_name)

* `N`: It is a positive value which determine number of rows preceding/succeeding the current row. If it is omitted in query then its default value is 1.

* Here's a query that uses the `LAG()` function to 
calculate the difference in `sales_amount` between 
the **current row** ( R ) and the **previous row** ( R - 1 ):

```sql 
SELECT
    sales_id,
    sales_date,
    sales_amount,
    LAG(sales_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS previous_sales_amount,
    sales_amount - LAG(sales_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS sales_difference
FROM
    sales;
```

### Explanation

- `LAG(sales_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date)`: This part of the query retrieves the `sales_amount` from the previous row, ordered by `sales_date`.
- `sales_amount - LAG(sales_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date)`: This calculates the difference between the current row's `sales_amount` and the previous row's `sales_amount`.

### Result

The result set will look like this:

```plaintext
+----------+------------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------------+
| sales_id | sales_date | sales_amount | previous_sales_amount | sales_difference|
+----------+------------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------------+
|        1 | 2025-01-01 |      1000.00 |               NULL    |            NULL |
|        2 | 2025-01-02 |      1500.00 |            1000.00    |           500.00|
|        3 | 2025-01-03 |      2000.00 |            1500.00    |           500.00|
|        4 | 2025-01-04 |      1800.00 |            2000.00    |          -200.00|
|        5 | 2025-01-05 |      2200.00 |            1800.00    |           400.00|
+----------+------------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------------+
```

In this result:
- The `previous_sales_amount` column shows the `sales_amount` from the previous row.
- The `sales_difference` column shows the difference between the current row's `sales_amount` and the previous row's `sales_amount`. For the first row, the `previous_sales_amount` is `NULL` since there is no preceding row.

### **Query 9**: Calculates the year-over-year growth in sales.

~~~sql
-- Query 9: Year-over-year growth in sales
WITH YearlySales AS (
    SELECT 
        d.year, 
        SUM(s.sales_amount) AS total_sales_amount
    FROM 
        Sales s
    JOIN 
        Dates d ON s.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY 
        d.year
)
SELECT 
    year,
    total_sales_amount,
    LAG(total_sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_sales,
    (total_sales_amount - LAG(total_sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY year)) / LAG(total_sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY year) * 100 AS year_over_year_growth
FROM 
    YearlySales
ORDER BY 
    year;
~~~


### **Query 10**: Calculates the customer retention rate 
    by identifying customers who made purchases in consecutive years.

~~~sql
-- Query 10: Customer retention rate 
-- (customers who made purchases in consecutive years)
WITH CustomerYear AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id, 
        d.year
    FROM 
        Sales s
    JOIN 
        Customer c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN 
        Dates d ON s.date_id = d.date_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, d.year
)
SELECT 
    cy1.year AS year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cy1.customer_id) AS customers_this_year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cy2.customer_id) AS customers_last_year,
    (COUNT(DISTINCT cy1.customer_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT cy2.customer_id)) * 100 AS retention_rate
FROM 
    CustomerYear cy1
LEFT JOIN 
    CustomerYear cy2 ON cy1.customer_id = cy2.customer_id AND 
    cy1.year = cy2.year + 1
GROUP BY 
    cy1.year
ORDER BY 
    cy1.year;
