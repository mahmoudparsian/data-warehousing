# `LAG()` and `HEAD()`

	In MySQL, the `LAG()` function is a window function 
	that allows you to access the value of a column from 
	a previous row in the same result set. 

### The `HEAD()` function, however, **does NOT exist in MySQL**. 	
	The `HEAD()` function, however, **does NOT exist in 
	MySQL**. 	Instead, you can use the `LIMIT` clause to 
	achieve similar functionality (i.e., retrieving the 
	first few rows).

Below is an example query that demonstrates the use of `LAG()` and `LIMIT` (as a substitute for `HEAD()`).

---

### Example Scenario
Assume you have a table named `sales` with the following columns:

- `id` (INT): Primary key
- `sale_date` (DATE): Date of the sale
- `amount` (DECIMAL): Amount of the sale

### Objective
1. Use `LAG()` to compare the current row's `amount` with the previous row's `amount`.
2. Retrieve the first 5 rows of the result (simulating `HEAD()`).

---

### Query Example

```sql
-- Step 1: Use LAG() to compare the current 
-- row's amount with the previous row's amount
SELECT
    id,
    sale_date,
    amount,
    LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS previous_amount,
    amount - LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS amount_difference
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    sale_date
LIMIT 5; -- Step 2: Retrieve the first 5 rows
```

---

### Explanation
1. **`LAG()` Function**:
   - `LAG(amount, 1)` retrieves the `amount` from the previous row (based on the `ORDER BY sale_date`).
   - The `amount_difference` column calculates the difference between the current row's `amount` and the previous row's `amount`.

2. **`LIMIT` Clause**:
   - The `LIMIT 5` clause restricts the result to the first 5 rows, simulating the behavior of a `HEAD()` function.

---

### Sample Output
If the `sales` table contains the following data:

| id  | sale_date  | amount |
|-----|------------|--------|
| 1   | 2025-01-01 | 100    |
| 2   | 2025-01-02 | 200    |
| 3   | 2025-01-03 | 150    |
| 4   | 2025-01-04 | 300    |
| 5   | 2025-01-05 | 250    |
| 6   | 2025-01-06 | 400    |

The query will return:

| id  | sale_date  | amount | previous_amount | amount_difference |
|-----|------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1   | 2025-01-01 | 100    | NULL            | NULL              |
| 2   | 2025-01-02 | 200    | 100             | 100               |
| 3   | 2025-01-03 | 150    | 200             | -50               |
| 4   | 2025-01-04 | 300    | 150             | 150               |
| 5   | 2025-01-05 | 250    | 300             | -50               |

---

### Notes
- The `LAG()` function is a powerful tool for comparing rows in a dataset.
- The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned, which is equivalent to the functionality of `HEAD()` in other systems.
