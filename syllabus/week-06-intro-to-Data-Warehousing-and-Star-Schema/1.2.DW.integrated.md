# data warehouse is "integrated"

	When we say that a data warehouse is "integrated," 
	it means that the data warehouse consolidates data 
	from different source systems into a consistent, 
	unified format. This integration ensures that data 
	from various sources is combined in a way that provides 
	a coherent and comprehensive view of the business.

### Characteristics of an Integrated Data Warehouse:

1. **Consistent Data Formats**: Data from different sources is transformed into a consistent format. This includes standardizing data types, naming conventions, and units of measurement.

2. **Unified Data Model**: The data warehouse uses a unified data model that integrates data from multiple operational systems. This model ensures that data is logically organized and related.

3. **Elimination of Redundancies**: Integration involves removing redundancies and inconsistencies in the data. This process ensures that the data is accurate and reliable.

4. **Cross-System Data Relationships**: Integrated data warehouses establish relationships between data from different systems. For example, linking customer data from a CRM system with sales data from an ERP system.

5. **Consolidated View**: Users can access a consolidated view of the data, which provides a single version of the truth. This view supports more effective analysis and decision-making.

### Example

Consider a company with multiple operational systems:

- **CRM System**: Contains customer information.
- **ERP System**: Manages sales and financial data.
- **Inventory System**: Tracks product inventory levels.

In an integrated data warehouse, data from these systems is combined and standardized. For example:

- Customer data from the CRM system is matched with sales data from the ERP system and inventory data from the inventory system.
- Data formats such as date formats, currency, and units of measurement are standardized.
- Redundant and inconsistent data is cleaned and consolidated.

### Benefits of Integration

- **Improved Data Quality**: Integration improves the quality and accuracy of the data by eliminating inconsistencies and redundancies.
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Users can perform more comprehensive and meaningful analyses by accessing integrated data from multiple sources.
- **Better Decision-Making**: A consolidated view of the data provides a single version of the truth, enabling better informed and more confident decision-making.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Integration reduces the need for manual data reconciliation and consolidation, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.

### Conclusion

Integration is a key characteristic of data warehouses that ensures data from different sources is combined into a consistent, unified format. This integration facilitates better data analysis, reporting, and decision-making by providing a comprehensive and coherent view of the business.
