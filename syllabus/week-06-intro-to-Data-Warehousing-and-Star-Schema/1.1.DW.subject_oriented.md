# data warehouse is "subject-oriented"

	When we say that a data warehouse is "subject-oriented," 
	it means that the data warehouse is organized around 
	the key subjects or areas of interest within an
	organization, rather than around the specific applications
	or processes. This organization allows for a more 
	holistic and comprehensive view of the data related to 
	a particular subject, enabling better decision-making 
	and analysis.

### Characteristics of a Subject-Oriented Data Warehouse:

1. **Focus on Key Subjects**: The data warehouse is designed to focus on major subjects like customers, sales, products, and finance, rather than on the day-to-day operations.

2. **Integrated Data**: Data from various operational systems is integrated and consolidated around these subjects. This integration ensures consistency and coherence in the data, making it easier to analyze and draw insights.

3. **Simplified Data Access**: By organizing data around subjects, users can access and analyze the information they need without dealing with the complexities of multiple operational systems.

4. **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Subject-oriented data warehouses provide a comprehensive view of key business areas, enabling better strategic decision-making and more effective business planning.

### Example

For instance, consider a retail organization. In a subject-oriented data warehouse, the data might be organized around subjects such as:

- **Customers**: Information about customer demographics, purchase history, preferences, etc.
- **Products**: Details about products, categories, pricing, inventory levels, etc.
- **Sales**: Data related to sales transactions, revenue, discounts, etc.
- **Suppliers**: Information about suppliers, their performance, and relationships.

By organizing the data warehouse around these subjects, the organization can perform more effective and targeted analyses, such as customer behavior analysis, sales trend forecasting, product performance evaluation, and supplier management.

### Conclusion

Subject orientation is a fundamental characteristic of data warehouses that helps to ensure that the data is organized in a way that aligns with the key areas of interest within an organization. This organization facilitates better data analysis, reporting, and decision-making.
